		<p>About me:</p>
	
		<p>I'm taking this course because it meshes directly with the work I do as a member of the Southwest Environmental Finance Center ("SW EFC").  
			The SW EFC is a program of UNMâ€™s Center for Water and Environment which is affiliated with the 
			Civil Engineering Department. The SW EFC, formerly called the New Mexico Environmental Finance Center, 
			has been in business within a university setting since 1992. The SW EFC is dedicated to assisting state 
			and local governments with the broad financial implications of environmental service delivery and 
			environmental compliance.   <p/>
