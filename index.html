			Civil Engineering Department. The SW EFC, formerly called the New Mexico Environmental Finance Center, 
			has been in business within a university setting since 1992. The SW EFC is dedicated to assisting state 
			and local governments with the broad financial implications of environmental service delivery and 
			environmental compliance.   <p/>
